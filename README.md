# TodoVue
<h4>This is a very simple to-do app with basic styling that I made using Vue.js to familiarize myself with javascript and this framewokr</h4>

It has a json file from which to-do items are read and then displayed in the browser. It is then possible to mark specific item as complete/incomplete and/or delete it and also add new item.
